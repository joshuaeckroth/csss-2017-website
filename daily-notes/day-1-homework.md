# Day 1 Homework

(**Homework is optional!**)

## Task 1

Update your Python number-guessing game from class so that the user can guess infinitely-many times until the user guesses the right number. Use a "while" loop.

## Task 2

Find a news article about a cyberattack we did not talk about in class. Prepare to tell us about this attack on day 2. Tell us what happened and who did it (if anyone knows).
