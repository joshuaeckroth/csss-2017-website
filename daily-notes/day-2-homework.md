# Day 2 Homework

(**Homework is optional!**)

## Task 1

Update the BBS client we developed in class to ask the user which domain the client should connect to, then finds that domain in our mini-DNS server and connects to the corresponding IP address.

## Task 2

Update the BBS server and DNS server code from class to support "reverse DNS lookup", i.e., to report the domain for a given IP. Then show this domain in the posts saved by the BBS server instead of the IP of the user who made the post. Note, you'll need to update the DNS server so it first receives a command like "resolve" (find the IP for given domain) or "reverse" (find the domain for a given IP), since now it needs to perform two different kinds of actions.

## Task 3

Register your own domain name (a real one), from [Google](https://domains.google/#/) or [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or some similar domain registrar. Note, this costs real money (about $10 typically) so it is entirely optional!
