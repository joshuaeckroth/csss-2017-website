# Preparation

## Where to go

The class will meet in Lynn Business Center (LBC) room 317. LBC can be found on this [map](http://www.myatlascms.com/map/?id=296#!s/key=lynn?m/52663). There is a parking lot next to the building. Please arrive by 9am each day (June 12-16). We'll finish class at 3pm each day.

## What to bring

If you have a laptop, you may bring it and write all your code on your own machine. The class takes place in a computer lab so there will be a computer for everyone who does not bring a laptop. If you bring a laptop, you'll want [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) so you can connect to a Linux machine we'll be using for the class exercises. You should also grab a file transfer program like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) and perhaps a code editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

Except for an optional laptop, you will not need any supplies. This website will be your primary resource for course materials. We will give you access to an individual Linux server on the Google Cloud Platform. Every student will run their code on their own server in the cloud. A couple weeks after the camp ends, the servers will be shut down, although you are free to use Google's [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/) to keep your own cloud server indefinitely for free.

## What to study

If you wish to get a head start on the course materials, peruse this website as well as sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security) and journalists like [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/) and [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/). For Python, look at [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) (note the free book link at the bottom, [linked here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)). Most of work will be done on a Linux terminal, so if you have a chance to install Linux ahead of time (such as the new [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)), you might consider playing around with [basic Linux commands](https://diyhacking.com/linux-commands-for-beginners/).
